THE THRESHOLD OVERVIEW
======================

The Threshold receives messages and then forwards them to the room the messages belong in. The Threshold receives messages from the Twilio servers as a HTTP request. It forwards messages depending on who the messages come from and if the number is subscribed to a room. If the number is not subscribed to a room then the message is discarded. Every time a message is received a message is sent to the Twilio servers to be forwarded back to the numbers the message was received from. This is to confirm the message was received and processed.

DATABASES
---------

The Threshold is run using two separate databases. The main database is the database the stores all of the main data. This includes the rooms, subscribers to the rooms and messages sent to each room. By default this is a Redis database. The connection between the main application and the databases connection will be standardised. This will allow any database to be dropped in a used as the main database. Postgres will be implemented as another option. TODO: For other databases an implementation can be supplied by the file name.

The other database that The Threshold relies on is an authentication database. This uses a Postgres database. See AUTHENTICATION below. 

A future feature idea is to use the main database as a funnel for all messages. When using Redis it would use Redis' pub-sub feature. Need to look into the same sort of thing in Postgres. For other custom databases this feature can be turned on and off depending on if the database/implementation support some sort of pub-sub functionality. Using message funneling will provide two main advantages over the complexity it will cause. First, it will allow messages to come from any source. This will make it easy to extend to other data sources. Right now messages can only be received from Twilio's servers. The other advantage will allow for clustering of The Threshold servers. This will allow load balancing by having slave servers only subscribed to certain rooms. This needs to be thought about some more once I decide to implement this.

Name           Structure 

rooms:         rooms -> rooms

subscribers:   (room) -> users 

subscriptions: (phone #) - (room)

messages:      sms-(room) -> messages

NOTE: Anything above surrounded in '()' are variables to be filled in with user specified info, '-' represents a key to value pair, '->' represents a key to list.

FUTURE
------

* Add user persistence 
* Turn off message confirmation in user setting.
* Subscribing to multiple rooms 
* Scaling with multiple Twilio numbers
* Redis pub-sub system, see above Redis docs. Is this doable in Postgres if need be?
* Testing
